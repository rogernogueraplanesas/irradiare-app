Irradiare's DevTrack App is an internal tool designed to **monitor the performance and efficiency** of the companyâ€™s implemented projects over time, utilizing key indicator data. In addition to tracking, the app facilitates **forecasting project outcomes**, enabling the company to optimize the timing of new initiatives based on predicted values for these indicators.<br>
Project impact can be analyzed across **multiple geographical levels**, including parishes, municipalities, districts, and the national level. Additionally, the app supports tracking indicators based on NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) levels.<br>
The app's database is populated with indicator data sourced from [E-REDES](https://e-redes.opendatasoft.com/explore/?sort=modified), [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database), [INE](https://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_api&INST=322751522), and [The World Bank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation).

The development of the DevTrack App is driven by Irradiare's **strategic commitment to leveraging data for more informed decision-making**. As the company continues to implement diverse projects, it has become increasingly important to have a precise, data-driven summary of project evolution over time.<br>
By integrating key economic, social, and environmental indicators, the app provides a comprehensive view of project performance and potential.<br>
Furthermore, the ability to forecast these indicators offers the company valuable insights into the future impact of its initiatives, allowing for better prioritization of upcoming projects. This data-backed approach enables the company to assess, with greater accuracy, which projects to bid on next, ensuring more logical, safer, and efficient project selection and execution.<br>
The flexibility to connect various dimensions of performance within the app strengthens decision-making, fostering an optimized, strategic, and long-term perspective for the company's future initiatives.
