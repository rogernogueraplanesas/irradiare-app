A brief guide for setting up and executing the application.

- First, create and activate a virtual environment (venv) in the project's folder (irradiare-app).
- Once created, install the requirements found in requirements.txt by executing the next command in the terminal:


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- After the requirements are installed, set the current directory to the [indicators_data](/app/indicators_data) folder.
